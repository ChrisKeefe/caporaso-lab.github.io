        summary: >
            QIIME is an open-source, GPL-licensed platform for the analysis and
            comparison of microbial communities (or microbiomes) based on DNA
            sequence data. QIIME is very widely used, having been cited over
            3200 times since its publication in 2010.

      - name: Longitudinal and spatial characterization of microbial communities in offices
        summary: >
            As North Americans we spend the vast majority of our time indoors.
            We know that microbial communities cohabit our indoor spaces,
            including our homes and offices, but we know very little about
            what factors drive effect the microbial communities that establish
            in these environments. This study investigates the effect of climate
            and building parameters on how and what microbes establish in office
            buildings.

      - name: Moisture, wetting, and fungal growth measurement on common indoor surfaces.
        summary: >
            This project aims to characterize, both qualitatively and
            quantitiatively, the fungal communities that establish on drywall
            surfaces when they're exposed to moisture. We'll simulate different
            sources of water infiltration in built environments, such as
            flooding and leaks, and characterize fungal communities on drywall
            in real environments that have been damaged by moisture.

      - name: The human gut microbiota and its viruses - Keys to treating autism?
        summary: >
            Recent studies suggest that gut microbiota have a role in Autism
            Spectrum Disorders (ASD), potentially arising from their role in
            modulating the immune system and gastrointestinal (GI) function. We
            are examining changes in behavior, GI symptoms and the gut microbial
            and viral communities before and after administration of the FMT
            treatment over 18 weeks.

      - name: Microbes, bile acids and colorectal cancer
        summary: >
            In this study we're testing a mechanistic hypothesis about how
            treatment of colorectal adenoma and cancer (CRA and CRC) patients
            with Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) reduces the recurrance of CRA by
            profiling gut microbial communities and bile acids before and after
            treatment with UDCA.

        summary: >
            We regularly teach QIIME workshops at conferences and universities
            around the world. These are hands-on, and work best when they're
            designed to be 2-3 days for approximately 30 students.

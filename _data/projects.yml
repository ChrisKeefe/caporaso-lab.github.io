      - name: Longitudinal and spatial characterization of microbial communities in offices
        summary: >
            As North Americans we spend the vast majority of our time indoors.
            We know that microbial communities cohabit our homes, offices,
            vehicles, and hospitals (among other indoor spaces). While typically
            harmless, under certain circumstances these communities can have a
            negative impact on the health of building inhabitants. This study
            investigates the effect of climate and building parameters on how
            and what microbes establish in office buildings.

      - name: Moisture, wetting, and fungal growth measurement on common indoor surfaces.
        summary: >
            This project aims to characterize, both qualitatively and
            quantitiatively, the fungal communities that establish on drywall
            surfaces under different wetting regimes. In this project we'll
            simulate different sources of water such as flooding and leaks.

      - name: The human gut microbiota and its viruses - Keys to treating autism?
        summary: >
            Recent studies suggest that gut microbiota have a role in Autism
            Spectrum Disorders (ASD), potentially arising from their role in
            modulating the immune system and gastrointestinal (GI) function. We
            are examining changes in behavior, GI symptoms and the gut microbial
            and viral communities before and after administration of the FMT
            treatment over 18 weeks.

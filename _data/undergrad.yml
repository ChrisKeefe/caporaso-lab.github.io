        summary: >
            Undergraduate Researchers in the Caporaso Lab develop and support
            QIIME 2, a leading microbiome bioinformatics platform. Undergrads
            contribute to the QIIME 2 framework (Python), build interactive data
            visualizations (JavaScript, various frameworks), create and manage
            product documentation (Jinja2, Sphinx), provide user support(Discourse),
            explore DevOps and build pipelines (Concourse CI), and develop bioinformatics
            plugins (Various languages).

        summary: >
            As members of the Center for Applied Microbiome Science, undergraduates
            perform bioinformatics analysis on contemporary studies. These
            contributions yield published work, experience with research design,
            and valuable collaborative relationships.

      - name: Flexible Work Schedule
        summary: >
            Undergraduates have to balance diverse responsibilities, and academic
            performance is top priority. Students are asked to work 15-20 hours
            per week while school is in session, and may work up to 40 hours during
            breaks. Scheduling is flexible to accommodate courswork and exam requirements.

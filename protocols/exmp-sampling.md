#                   EXMP Fecal Sampling Instructions


Please read through all of these instructions *BEFORE* you begin collecting a fecal sample.

Trillions of harmless or beneficial microorganisms (tiny living things such as bacteria) live on and within our bodies. During and after birth, our bodies begin to accumulate this diverse community of microorganisms. The composition of this community differs between people and the scientific community is still exploring why this is. There is evidence that our microbial communities are influenced by our parents, our physical environment, what we eat and potentially even our genes. Our resident microbes occupy many body habitats, including the skin and mucosal surfaces, and the gastrointestinal tract.

As part of this study, you will be asked to donate fecal samples of your microorganisms that will be collected on sterile cotton tipped swabs (i.e., “Q­tips”).  You will perform the sampling. Ziploc bags containing swabs will be distributed at the initial meeting (2 kits) and after that weekly from the drop off location.

Samples should be taken each Sunday and Thursday following the instructions detailed below.

  *	Please note: there are no back-up swabs.
  *	If you accidentally drop the swab, or touch it to anything other than the specific sampling site, please skip that sample. The sample can be simply thrown away.

You will fill out one Per Sample Event Questionnaire for every sample collected.

#                 Step by step directions for fecal sampling


You will be provided kits to collect fecal swab samples, these should be collected on Sunday and Thursday (or as close to these days as possible). Each time you collect a sample, follow these instructions. Collect each of these 2 weekly samples, one at a time, on Sunday and Thursday.

  1.	From the zip­lock bag provided by the researchers, take out a labeled tube.  
  2.	Take the cotton swab out of the labeled tube, handling the swab only by the red plastic handle.  
  3.	Sampling protocol
   *	You are asked to donate microorganisms from the intestinal microhabitat by collecting a fecal smear from used bathroom tissue by taking a swab of the your used tissue.
   *	To do this, rub the swab over the used portion of the tissue until there is visible fecal material on the swab (i.e. the swab is brown).
  4.	Return the sample swab to the labeled tube immediately after sampling and close the cap securely.
  5.	Return the swab to the Ziploc bag.
  6.	Be sure to wash your hands with soap and water after sampling to avoid contamination.  
  7. Submit your sample ID via the Per Sample Event Questionnaire.
  8. Take to the drop off point at the ARD building (room 220) at NAU within 48 hours of sampling.
  *	If you are not able to reach a drop off location within 48 hours, store the samples in a cool (approximately room temperature) dry place out of the reach of children and indicate that it has been more than 48 hours since collection on the sample bag.
  *	Note: these samples are unlikely to be useable and hence it will not count toward your sample count. This will affect your eligibility for compensation if this occurs more than twice.

# Appendix A: Sample type collection instructions

FECAL: Rub both cotton tips on a fecal specimen (ideally a used piece toilet paper). Collect a small amount of biomass (maximum collection would be to saturate 1/2 a swab). More is not better! The ideal amount of biomass collected is shown in the figure below.

*A fecal sample showing an ideal amount of material collected. Excessive amounts of material will result in the nonrefundable exclusion of your sample. See below for examples.*

It is important that the amount of material collected is small for two reasons. First off, the amount of material could bias the result of your sample (e.g., mold growth might contaminate the sample). Second, excess material cannot be handled by our processing pipeline. Our molecular methods are incredibly sensitive, and require nanograms (billionths of a gram) of DNA. Previous studies have shown that even a tiny amount of material, like in the picture above, is sufficient to assess the microbial life in your gastrointestinal tract. The figures below show examples of good and bad fecal samples. Examples of good and bad samples. From left to right, the first two images are good samples and the next two images are bad samples.

DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FECAL SAMPLES: We recognize that some participants have chronic constipation. In these instances, what we recommend is the “catch and release” method, using 2-4 paper towels (enough to not get any on you, but to also avoid clogging the toilet). If the specimen is not soft, please just rub both sides of the cotton swabs on it to get a light smear. And of course, make sure to wash your hands afterwards.

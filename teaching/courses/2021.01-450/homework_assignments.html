<p>Download a genome and compute its GC content. Copy or download <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iY1sfH9uKulmO0CLugtQOzBoAIGqh0oIwzZfa1ARay0/edit?usp=sharing">the assignment template</a>, fill in your answers, and turn the assignment in by email as a PDF. <strong>While you will get started on this assignment in class (optionally in small groups), you will complete the questions in assignment yourself.</strong></p>
<p>Note that there are various ways that you can just look up the GC content, including via the IMG website. I’m asking you to compute it, and you’re being graded on your descriptions. Getting the right answer is a bonus (i.e., if you spend a couple of hours trying, and get it wrong, you’ll be graded on your well-documented effort, not your final answer).</p>
<p>Hints: Start with the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome">NCBI Genome Browser</a>, and work with a bacterial, archaeal or viral genome. You can also work with a eukaryote genome, but it may be quite a bit more challenging.</p>
<p>Be creative - there are many ways to achieve this.</p>

<h2>Assignment 3: Python programming (see schedule for due date, 20 points)<a class="headerlink" href="#assignment-3-python-programming-see-schedule-for-due-date-20-points" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this assignment you’ll apply some of the topics we covered in our Python programming lectures to write a Python script that can help you clean up information in a microbiome sample metadata file. The sample metadata that you’ll work with here is from the Yellowstone Hot Springs study that Dr. Caporaso covered in class, and you’ll modify a few functions in a template script to help standardize values in this file for use in microbiome analysis.</p>
<p>You can begin by downloading the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/imi5b9m3aalauvl/fix_table.py?dl=0">template script</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qi4p4btf2fa2b0y/test_fix_table.py?dl=0">a test script</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yq12tfbbjhg5ogh/yellowstone.csv?dl=0">the input file</a>. You’ll then upload these to the class Jupyter Notebook server, which you can access <a class="reference external" href="https://ondemand.hpc.nau.edu/">here</a>.</p>
<p>After uploading these files, you should be able to run the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">python</span> <span class="n">test_fix_table</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">py</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is a test file that evaluates the accuracy of the functions that you’ve written by providing them with specific input, and then comparing their output to an expected result. It should report 16 failures, and you can use this to test whether your code is working correctly. You can run this as you make edits to the template script. When there are zero failures, you’ll know that you have completely the assignment correctly.</p>
<p>Your code will do a few things. Acting only on the <cite>Site</cite> column in the table, it will remove leading and trailing whitespace, and convert the value to lowercase. Acting on the temperature column, it will remove units if they are present (this will be either <cite>F</cite> or <cite>f</cite>, for Fahrenheit), and convert the temperature value from Fahrenheit to Celsius. And finally, it will remove any rows that start with a <cite>#</cite> character, as these are often interpreted as comment lines that do not contain data. To achieve this, open the <cite>fix_table.py</cite> script and begin reading the comments to see what code you’ll need to edit. All of your edits will be in the <cite>fix_table.py</cite> file.</p>
<p>You can apply your script to the input file as follows to created a new, cleaned up sample metadata file:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">python</span> <span class="n">fix_table</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">py</span> <span class="n">yellowstone</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">csv</span> <span class="n">yellowstone</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">clean</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">csv</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>(You can name the output file whatever you’d like  - here I named it <cite>yellowstone-clean.csv</cite>.)</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>To submit this assignment, after you have completed your code and tested it, rename your script to include your NAU id in the name, so the file name looks like: <cite>fix-table-&lt;nau-id&gt;.py</cite>, where <cite>&lt;nau-id&gt;</cite> is replaced with your NAU id. For example, my file would be named <cite>fix-table-jgc53.py</cite>.

<h2>Assignment 5: Learning and presenting on a bioinformatics workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#assignment-5-learning-and-presenting-on-a-bioinformatics-workflow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In assignment 5 you will learn about and present on a bioinformatics workflow that is being used or proposed for SARS-CoV-2 research. This is a very real world bioinformatics task. In fact, I’m doing this very same thing at the moment as <a class="reference external" href="https://azdailysun.com/news/local/tgen-diversifying-covid-19-testing-and-research/article_df3d2fb2-7540-5774-9ab0-a92cc481d786.html">we develop our capacity for sequencing and analyzing genomes from covid-19 cases in Arizona</a> at the Pathogen and Microbiome Institute.</p>
<p>You can do this in groups of up to three students, or work on this on your own. If you would like to create your own group or work on your own, please e-mail me with the full names of everyone in your group or to let me know that you want to work on your own by Tuesday, April 7th at 12:30pm. If I don’t hear from you by then, I will randomly assign you to a group by 5pm on Tuesday, April 7th. Any of these three options (working on your own, creating your own group, or being assigned to a group) are totally fine - given the current challenges that everyone is facing, I just want to make sure that you have the flexibility to choose whichever option works best for you.</p>
<p>For this assignment, you will turn in a video file in mp4 format by uploading it to <a class="reference external" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_0LgXLUqAl1o9J6_kyo5ZBbFQD9CQ4LC?usp=sharing">this Google Drive folder</a>. Each member of the group must contribute to the project in some way. This can be by doing research and writing a script for the video, presenting in the video, installing and demonstrating a workflow, or in some other way.</p>
<p>Choose one of the Bioinformatic Tools, Scripts or Workflows described in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/CDCgov/SARS-CoV-2_Sequencing#bioinformatic-tools-scripts-and-workflows">this document provided by the CDC</a> (choose something outside of the “0. General Resources” section). (Alternatively, if there is another bioinforamtics tool/script/workflow that you’re interested in learning about, and which is or could be related to SARS-CoV-2 research, email me to see if it would be a good subject for this presentation.) Present the tool/script/workflow of your choice in a video that is between 8-12 minutes long. Your presentation should address the following questions:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>What organization or people are providing this tool/script/workflow?</p></li>
<li><p>Who provided the funding for this tool/script/workflow (try to determine this, but don’t worry if you can’t find it - it may not be reported)?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the biological question that the tool/script/workflow is trying to address?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the motivation for addressing this question? (In other words, what could we learn by applying the tool/script/workflow?)</p></li>
<li><p>What computational technologies are used in this tool/script/workflow (e.g., bioinformatics software, programming language)?</p></li>
<li><p>What biological resources (e.g., public sequence databases) did the authors make use of?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the input to this tool/script/workflow?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the output from this tool/script/workflow?</p></li>
<li><p>Present either a demo of the tool/script/workflow (e.g., install it on your computer and run it with test data) or present an example of the output generated by this workflow and explain how to interpret it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All students in a group will receive the same grade on this assignment unless there is clear evidence that some student(s) didn’t contribute, in which case the rest of the group should e-mail me to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>Before choosing a tool/script/workflow to present on, you should look at several in the list. Some of these have higher quality descriptions and examples than others.</p>

<h2>Final project: Microbiome-based forensics with QIIME 2<a class="headerlink" href="#final-project-microbiome-based-forensics-with-qiime-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The final project is made up of three parts that you will work on in order. In this assignment, you’ll be using <a class="reference external" href="https://qiime2.org">QIIME 2</a> version 2020.2 to analyze two data sets. The objective of this assignment is to learn a bioinformatics tool from its documentation (Part 1), apply it to answer a specific question (Part 2), and report your findings (Part 3).</p>
<p>In <strong>Part 1</strong>, you’ll read and run the QIIME 2 <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.2/tutorials/moving-pictures/">Moving Pictures of the Human Microbiome tutorial</a>, a tutorial that is designed to be a first entry point into the QIIME 2 microbiome bioinformatics platform. This will familiarize you with running QIIME 2 and interpreting QIIME 2 output. In <strong>Part 2</strong>, you’ll adapt the commands from that tutorial to analyze another data set, where human-associated microbial communities were explored for their forensic potential. In <strong>Part 3</strong>, you’ll interpret and write up your results from <strong>Part 2</strong> in a three-page report. Before starting this assignment, you should read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/03/01/1000162107.full.pdf">Fierer et al (2010)</a>, where this forensic study was initially published. This will help you understand the study.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: This assignment includes some steps that will take time to run (possibly up to 20 minutes). You should avoid starting this assignment close to the deadline - if the server is backlogged because many people are using it, it may take time for your notebook server to be accessible. You are responsible for starting this in a timely manner!</p>
<p>For <strong>Part 1</strong>, you will run analyses in the Jupyter Notebook provided <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/igtz8go7gwaxg2j/qiime2-assignment-part1.ipynb?dl=0">here</a>. Note: Due to a configuration error on the server, at the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.2/tutorials/moving-pictures/#sequence-quality-control-and-feature-table-construction">Sequence Quality Control … step</a>, use Option 2 (deblur).</p>
<p>For <strong>Part 2</strong>, you will run analyses in the Jupyter Notebook provided <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/uw7782lpotoc915/qiime2-assignment-part2.ipynb?dl=0">here</a>, and answer the questions posted <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hhoRNohnCWtfE_z_cVb3Zti5BLf1mOzSQoNiY4wZjWw/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
<p>For <strong>Part 3</strong>, you will write a 2.5 to 3 page paper describing your analysis (details are provided below).</p>
<p>Download each of the notebooks from the links provided above. Log into the class Jupyter Notebook server, and create two new folders: one for assignment part 1, and one for assignment part 2. Upload each of the notebooks to it’s corresponding folder. (Creating these folders is important - otherwise it’ll be very easy to mix up the files from these two parts, which will lead to all sorts of confusing error messages.) Each notebook contains empty cells for you to work in.</p>

<h3>Items to turn in by email<a class="headerlink" href="#items-to-turn-in-by-email" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For <strong>Part 1</strong>, you’ll turn in the notebook containing the commands that you ran. Append your NAU ID to the beginning of the file name. For example, the file I turn in would be named <cite>jgc53-qiime2-assignment-part1.ipynb</cite>.</p>
<p>For <strong>Part 2</strong>, you’ll turn in the notebook containing the commands that you ran, as well as a completed question sheet (linked above), and the <cite>.qza</cite> or <cite>.qzv</cite> files that you reference in your answers in the question sheet (with the exception of any <cite>.qza</cite> or <cite>.qzv</cite> files that I’m providing for you). Append your NAU ID to the beginning of each file name. For example, the files I turn in would be named: <cite>jgc53-qiime2-assignment-part2.ipynb</cite>, <cite>jgc53-qiime2-assignment-part2-questions.pdf</cite>, and multiple files with names like <cite>jgc53-*.qzv</cite> (where the <cite>*</cite> is replaced with a descriptive name for each file, such as <cite>jgc53-taxonomy-barplot.qzv</cite>). Don’t try to submit artifacts that I’ve provided for you, such as <cite>gg-13-8-99-nb-classifier.qza</cite>. Some will be too large to send by email, and I already have them.</p>
<p>For <strong>Part 3</strong>, you will write a 2.5 to 3 page paper describing your analysis. <strong>Your paper should not be any shorter than 2.5 pages nor any longer than 3 pages. It must have 1.5 line spacing, 0.5” margins, and be written in 12 point Times New Roman font. Figures and tables are included in the page count, though the total space taken by these should be a maximum of one page.</strong> You’ll turn this file in as a PDF named <cite>final-paper-&lt;nau-id&gt;.pdf</cite>, where <cite>&lt;nau-id&gt;</cite> is replaced with your NAU id. For example, my file would be named <cite>final-paper-jgc53.pdf</cite>.</p>
<p>Write this as if you’re submitting to a journal, so your paper should contain:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A title and list of authors (just you, in this case). This should be in no more than 14 point font, and follow the margin/spacing requirements listed above.</p></li>
<li><p>An <em>Introduction</em> section describing the goals of the study (you can refer to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/03/01/1000162107.full.pdf">Fierer et al (2010)</a>);</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>Methods</em> section containing a brief description of your bioinformatics methods (e.g., what version of QIIME, what commands were used), and how the data was generated (e.g., sequencing platform);</p></li>
<li><p>And a <em>Results and Conclusions</em> section describing the results of your analysis.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You should address several specific questions in your <em>Results and Conclusions</em>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Which keyboard belonged to each of the human subjects? Back this up with figures and statistics that support your answer. Describe what each of your figures tells you.</p></li>
<li><p>Which bacterial phyla appear to be most useful for matching each individual to their keyboard? Refer to <em>Taxonomic barplots</em> to address this.</p></li>
<li><p>Which features were most different in abundance across the subjects? Refer to the <em>Taxonomic barplots</em> to address this. Present a table containing the most differentially abundant features and their taxonomy.</p></li>
<li><p>Which subject had the most features (i.e., the highest microbial community richness) in their skin microbiome, on average? Was the number of features across subjects significantly different?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please turn all of this in by e-mail to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:greg&#46;caporaso&#37;&#52;&#48;nau&#46;edu">greg<span>&#46;</span>caporaso<span>&#64;</span>nau<span>&#46;</span>edu</a> with subject: <em>final assignment</em>.</p>

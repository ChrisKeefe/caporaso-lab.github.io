# Undergraduate Research Opportunities

## Software development
Undergraduate Researchers in the Caporaso Lab develop and support QIIME 2, a leading
microbiome bioinformatics platform. Undergrads
  *  contribute to the QIIME 2 framework (Python)
  *  build interactive data visualizations (JavaScript, various frameworks)
  *  create and manage product documentation (Jinja2, Sphinx)
  *  provide user support(Discourse)
  *  explore DevOps and build pipelines (Concourse CI)
  *  develop bioinformatics plugins (Various languages).
  *  Version control experience???

## Microbiome bioinformatics
As members of the Center for Applied Microbiome Science, undergraduates perform
bioinformatics analysis on active studies. These contributions yield published
work, experience with research design, and valuable collaborative relationships. Examples: ???

## Presentations & Publications
In addition to a strong portfolio of GitHub contributions, undergraduate researchers
are supported in developing conference posters and presentations, collaborative,
and independent research publications. Caporaso Lab students have presented at:
- The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis ([SC18](https://sc18.supercomputing.org/))
- 3rd Workshop on Statistical and Algorithmic Challenges in Microbiome Data Analysis ([SACMDA3](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/event/3rd-workshop-on-statistical-and-algorithmic-challenges-in-microbiome-data-analysis/))
- Lorem Ipsum - do we need a separate page to link here, listing UG pubs???

## Research Travel
Funded opportunities to travel in support of research are frequent.
In recent years, students have visited CITY, CITY, CITY for QIIME 2 workshops
and academic conferences.

## Flexible Work Schedule
Undergraduates have to balance diverse responsibilities, and academic performance
is top priority. Students are asked to work 15-20 hours per week while school is
in session, and may work up to 40 hours during breaks. Scheduling is flexible to
accommodate courswork and exam requirements.

# Apply

## [Apply to PMI...](https://nau.edu/pmi/pathogen-microbiome-institute/undergraduate-employment-opportunities/)
To work with the Caporaso Lab, students must apply to the Pathogen and Microbiome
Institute. [Get the application](https://nau.edu/pmi/pathogen-microbiome-institute/undergraduate-employment-opportunities/),
complete, print, and hand-deliver to PMI during business hours at: Applied Research
& Development (building #56) PMI Business office (suite 210). If noone is available
to answer the doorbell, drop in the blue application box on the east side of the
third floor.

## ...then get in touch!
After delivering your application, [notify Matt Dillon](mailto: matthew.dillon@nau.edu)
by email. This will help us access and review your application in a timely manner.

# Contribute Informally

## [QIIME 2 on GitHub](https://github.com/qiime2/)
QIIME 2 is free, open, community-driven software. Pull requests are always welcome!
If you're not available for a formal position but would like to contribute, let
the team know in our [developer discussion](https://forum.qiime2.org/c/dev-discussion),
then check out our list of [good first issues](bit.ly/good_first_issues).

## [An Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics (IAB)](http://readiab.org/)
A free, open source interactive text that introduces readers to core concepts of
bioinformatics in the context of their implementation and application. IAB is
available as a learning resource, and also welcomes [community contributions](https://github.com/applied-bioinformatics/An-Introduction-to-Applied-Bioinformatics/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
as GitHub pull requests.
